# The Games I have – Retro 

Where are the asteroids found in the solar system? Is there an alien? Wait, I have something to show you that you will surely love. 

I created a [Floor Fountains](https://www.soothingcompany.com/water-fountains/floor-fountains.htm) of asteroids – a skeletal version. Look how the asteroids fall! And there are more: Lunar Lander, Space Invaders and Snake in JavaScript. I used a different version of the retro game and created a unique art. The first one is the falling asteroids, the second is the Lunar lander, the third is the space invaders and the fourth is the “snake” yes, it’s a game.
